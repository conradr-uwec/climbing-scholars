            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <p>Growing up, Evelyn May knew she wanted to work with children. She babysat her cousins, and was often referred to as "Miss May" by her family, even as a child. After teaching for 5 years at a local elementary school, Evelyn knew she could do something more. Climbing Scholars was born as a place for children to learn and grow in a welcoming, safe environment. Climbing Scholars is now run by Evelyn May's daughter, Priscilla May, but Evelyn still visits often.</p>
